# English Programming Language

Welcome to the English Programming Language project! This project aims to create a simple, easy-to-understand programming language designed to be as close to natural English as possible. The goal is to make programming accessible to everyone, including children and beginners.

## Features
* Natural Language Syntax: Commands are written in a way that resembles natural English sentences.
* Modular Design: Easily extend the language by adding new command modules.
* Interactive CLI: A simple command-line interface to enter and execute commands.
  
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.

## Installation
Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/english-programming-language.git
cd english-programming-language

```
Install the necessary dependencies (if any):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the CLI
```
Start the interactive command-line interface:

```
python cli.py
```
## Example Commands

* Set a variable: set x to 10
* Show a message: show x
* Multiply a variable: multiply x by 5
* Set another variable: set y to 20
* Multiply a variable by another variable: multiply y by x
  
## Adding New Commands

To add a new command:

1. Create a new file in the commands directory, e.g., new_command.py.
2. Define your command class in this file, inheriting from BaseCommand.
3. Update commands/__init__.py to include your new command class.
   
## Project Structure
* cli.py: The entry point for the interactive command-line interface.
* main.py: Handles command registry and dynamic loading of commands.
* commands/: Contains individual command modules.
* lexer.py: Tokenizes the input commands.
* parser.py: Parses the tokens into executable commands.
* interpreter.py: Executes the parsed commands.
